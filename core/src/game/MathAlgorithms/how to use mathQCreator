this is an example on how to use mathQCreator.

mathQCreator math = new mathQCreator();
math.runOperation(int path, int level, int doors, int gamemode);
int[][] answers = math.getAnswers();
String[] question = math.getQuestions();

So lets say there are 3 questions

to pull up the first question is obviously:
question[0];
to get the answers for the question:
answers[0]
the length of an answer array is always 5, where 0-3 are the multiple choice answers, 
and answer[4] contains the index of the correct index.

so... answers[0][0] answers[0][1] answers[0][2] answers[0][3]
are the multiple choice answers for question 1
answers[1][0] answers[1][1] answers[1][2] answers[1][3]
are the multiple choice answers for question 2

So to check for the answer of the correct answer to the question:
int answerIndex = answers[0][4];
int answer = answers[0][answerIndex];

HOWEVER YOU DONT NEED TO DO THIS
simply:
int answer = math.getCorrectAnswer();
AND BAM.

So the only 4 methods you need to know is:

math.runOperation(int path, int level, int doors, int gamemode);
math.getAnswers()
math.getQuestions()
math.getCorrectAnswer()
