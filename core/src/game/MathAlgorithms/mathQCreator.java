/*
 * Math Algorithm program
 * Author: Nathan Nguyen
 * Description: This class generates math problems
 * parameters: path, level, number of doors and gamemode
 * path is the chosen difficulty of the player
 * level is their current level, and gamemode is the mode they have chosen
 * there will be an array of questions for the num of doors
 * the answers will be stored in a 2d array, where the first row represents the question
 * and the second row represents the answers with the 5th column representing the correct index answer
 * might be private and an interface might be used to retrieve data
 * might split to two classes, one for questions and one for answers
 * don't really know what to do with it yet, but this class is kinda huge
 * 
 * NOTES ON STUFF THAT HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION:
 * the real answer can never be negative, however, the randomly generated answer array might produce a fake negative answer
